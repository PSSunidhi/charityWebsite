				<h2>How Poverty is Impacting India?</h2>
				<p>The word poverty means when a person doesn't have enough financial support to fulfill his basic needs. Poverty is one of the hardest problem which our country is facing since ages and due to COVID-19 this problem even increased to huge extend as people don't have work. Many migrants are not having food and they are even ready to walk to  their homes. Some are born poor while others make themselves poor like unemployment can lead to poverty.
</p>
				<br>
				<p>Poverty is impacting india in huge extend as it  effect the GDP growth of our country. Poverty impacts the overall development of the country. It even leads to starvation. Poverty reduces the standard of living , unhygienic lifestyle and poor sanitation can lead to many health related problems. Poverty brings many social-economic conditions like child marriage and many such social evils as they are not educated enough to think what is right or wrong.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Lots of measures should be taken to reduce poverty like poor children should be given free educated not till 14 years but till their graduation because when a child is given education he starts dreaming for his future and after 14 years government also don't provide them money to study. Reservations should not be given on the basis of caste but not on the  bases of income as these SC , ST , not being poor but get all the benefits. There are many more changes which government should take to reduce poverty like uplifting and helping NGO's . Last I would like to say that to be born poor is fate but to continue being poor is your fault.
